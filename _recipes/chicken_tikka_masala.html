tags: [meat, dinner, chicken, indian]

ingredients:
- "2-3 lbs leftover [Tandoori Chicken](tandoori_chicken)"
- "2 Tbsp [Garam Masala](garam_masala)"
- 1 large onion, diced
- 2-3 Tbsp tomato paste
- 1.5 Tbsp grated ginger
- 1.5 Tbsp grated garlic
- 1 Tbsp Kashmiri chili powder (or 0.5 Tbsp cayenne powder + 0.5 Tbsp paprika)
- 1 28 oz. can crushed tomatoes
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1-2 Tbsp sugar
- "[Fragrant Rice](fragrant_rice), optional"

directions:
- Tear apart the tandoori chicken by hand into bite-size pieces.
- Preheat a saucepan with oil on high heat until very hot. Add the onion and stir until it is starting to brown.
- Reduce the heat to medium and add the ginger, garlic, masala, chili powder, and tomato paste. Fry for a few seconds then mix with the onions.
- When the mixture is about to burn, add the crushed tomatoes and deglaze. Heavily reduce the sauce until the tomatoes are well caramelized, stirring occasionally.
- Stir in the cream, then add enough water to get a creamy texture, about 2 cups. Add the sugar and add salt to taste.
- Stir in the chicken pieces and allow them to warm up. Optionally, serve with rice.
