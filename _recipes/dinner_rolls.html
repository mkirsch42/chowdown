recipe_yield: 9 Rolls

ingredients:
- 20g bread flour
- 27g water
- 60g whole milk
- 320g bread flour
- 9g active dry yeast
- 3g fine sea salt
- 120g whole milk
- 56g granulated sugar
- 3 Tbsp unsalted butter, separated
- 2 eggs, room temperature
- 2 cloves garlic
- 4 Tbsp unsalted butter
- Flaky salt

directions:
- Make a tangzhong by combining 20g bread flour, 27g water, and 60 whole milk into a small saucepan. Heat over medium heat, stirring constantly until the mixture thickens into a paste. Remove from the pan.
- Heat 120g whole milk to 95&deg;F and mix in 9g active dry yeast. Allow to bloom for 10 minutes.
- Mix together 320g bread flour, 3g fine sea salt, and 56g sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment.
- With the stand mixer on low, add the yeast mixture, the tangzhong, and 1 whole egg. Increase to medium-low once the dough begins to form.
- One tablespoon at a time, add 3 Tbsp softened butter while the stand mixer is still running. Allow the dough to mix for 7 minutes or until smooth.
- Form the dough into a taut ball and let rise in a lightly greased, covered bowl for 1-2 hours until well doubled in size.
- Punch down the dough and divide into 9 even pieces, about 75g each.
- Lightly spray a 9x9 cake pan with oil. Form each piece of dough into taut balls and arrange in the pan. Cover and allow to proof for 1-2 hours.
- Make an egg wash by whisking together one egg and a splash of milk. Gently brush each roll with the egg wash.
- Bake in a 350&deg;F oven for 28-30 minutes.
- While baking, mince 2 garlic cloves. Add 4 Tbsp butter and garlic to a small pan over medium heat. Once the butter is melted, cook for 30 more seconds and immediately remove from the heat.
- Once the rolls are done baking, immediately brush them with the garlic butter and sprinkle with flaky salt.
