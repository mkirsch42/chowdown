recipe_yield: 4-6 cups

ingredients:
- 2 cups Jasmine rice
- ~3 cups water
- Salt
- Black pepper
- 2-3 star anise
- 3-4 white cardamom pods, removed from their shells

directions:
- Very thoroughly rinse the rice with a strainer and/or bowl.
- Add the rice to a stockpot along with slightly less than 1.5x water by volume (some water was already absorbed during rinsing).
- Season to taste with salt, pepper, star anise, and cardamom.
- Cover the pot with a lid and bring to a boil over high heat. Do not remove the lid; listening for the boil may be required.
- Immediately reduce to medium-low heat and simmer for 10 minutes, keeping the lid on.
- Remove from the heat and allow the rice to steam with the lid on for 5 minutes.
- Remove the lid. There should be ~1/4 inch steam holes throughout the rice. Fluff the rice with a fork.
