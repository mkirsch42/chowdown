tags: [soup, vegetarian]

recipe_yield: 2 Liters

ingredients:
- 1.5 lbs (700 g) broccoli
- 2 Tbsp canola oil
- 3 Tbsp unsalted butter
- 1 medium onion
- 1 medium carrot
- 4 cloves garlic
- 2 cups chicken stock
- 3 cups whole milk
- 1 small russet potato
- 12 ounces cheddar cheese, grated
- 8 ounces colby jack cheese, grated
- 1 teaspoon dried mustard powder
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Hot sauce (optional)
- Bacon bits (optional)
- Olive oil (optional)

directions:
- Separate the broccoli stems and florets, making sure the florets are small enough to easily fit on a spoon.
- Roughly chop the onion and carrot into similarly sized pieces. Thinly slice the broccoli stems and chop them if too long.
- Peel and thinly slice the garlic; peel and roughly chop the potato.
- Add canola or vegetable oil to a dutch oven and heat over high heat until shimmering.
- Add the florets and do not move until lightly charred, about 1 minute. Stir, season with salt and pepper, and continue cooking and stirring occasionally until tender and charred, about 2 more minutes. Transfer to a baking sheet to cool.
- Over medium heat, add the onion, carrot, and broccoli stems. Season with salt and pepper and cook while stirring until tender but not brown, about 5-8 minutes.
- Thinly slice the garlic and add to the vegetables. Stir and cook for 30 more seconds or until very fragrant.
- Add the stock, milk, and potato. Bring to a boil over high heat then reduce to a simmer. Cook and stir frequently for 30 minutes or until the potatoes are very tender. Make sure a skin does not form on top of the soup.
- Toss the cheeses together with the mustard powder. Add to the soup in batches, incorporating with an immersion or countertop blender.
- Add the florets back to the soup. Quickly pulse with a blender to break up some of the florets. Add salt and black pepper to taste.
- Optionally, mix in or garnish with hot sauce, bacon bits, and olive oil.
