ingredients:
- Water
- Bread Flour
- Whole Wheat Flour

directions:
- "Day 1: Mix 100g Whole Wheat flour and 150g lukewarm water (85° F). Mix thoroughly and let rise loosely covered at warm room temperature (70-75° F) for 24 hours."
- "Day 2: Remove all the mature starter from the jar and add back 70g (inoculation). Stir in 115g lukewarm water (85° F). Mix in 50g bread flour and 50g whole wheat flour. Let rise loosely covered at warm room temperature (70-75° F) for 24 hours."
- "Day 3: Same as day 2. 70g inoculation, 115g water (85° F), 50g whole wheat flour, 50g bread flour."
- "Day 4: 70g inoculation, **100g** water (85° F), 50g whole wheat flour, 50g bread flour."
- "Day 5: 70g inoculation, 100g water (85° F), 50g whole wheat flour, 50g bread flour."
- "Day 6: **50g** inoculation, 100g water (85° F), 50g whole wheat flour, 50g bread flour. If the starter doesn't almost double in size 8-10 hours after this feeding, repeat this day's feeding until it does, then continue to day 7."
- "Day 7: **30g** inoculation, 100g water (85° F), 50g whole wheat flour, 50g bread flour. The discard starter can now be stored and accumulated in the fridge for [Sourdough Discard Recipes](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/collections/sourdough-discard-recipes). When a layer of liquid forms on top of the discard, it has gone bad and must be thrown out. Repeat this feeding for a few days."
- After repeating the day 7 feeding for few days, feed the starter according to the [Sourdough Starter](sourdough-starter) recipe.
