recipe_yield: 1 Steak

ingredients:
- 1 Rib-eye steak, at least 1.5" thick
- 1.5 Tbsp butter
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 4 garlic cloves, crushed and left in their skin
- 1 bundle thyme
- Neutral oil

directions:
- At least one day before cooking, defrost the steak and generously sprinkle with kosher salt on both sides, gently pressing the salt into the meat. Let rest for at least a day in the fridge on a wire rack, loosely tented with aluminum foil.
- Preheat the oven the 250&deg;F.
- Crack black pepper onto both sides of the steak and insert into the oven, still on the wire rack with a rimmed baking sheet underneath.
- Let the steak come up to 110&deg;F, about 40-50 minutes. Flip the steak halfway through.
- During the last 3-4 minutes in the oven, preheat oil in a cast iron skillet over high heat until smoking.
- Take the steak out of the oven and transfer to the cast iron. Immediately add the butter, garlic cloves, and thyme.
- Baste the steak with the butter in the pan. Once the steak is browned on one side (about 1-3 minutes), flip and continue basting. Once both sides are brown, use tongs to hold the steak on its side and cook the fat cap.
