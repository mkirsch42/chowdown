title: Pasta al Limone
tags: [pasta]

ingredients:
- 0.5 lb spaghetti
- 1 lemon
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 3 cloves garlic, peeled & thinly sliced
- Chili flakes
- 2oz parmesan cheese
- 1 egg
- 1 egg yolk
- 1 Tbsp heavy cream
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped (optional)

directions:
- Add just enough water to a pot to cover and cook the pasta along with ~1 Tbsp of kosher salt. Bring to a boil and cook the pasta.
- About 5 minutes before the pasta is done cooking, add olive oil to a wide pan along with the garlic, chili flakes, zest of 1 lemon, and black pepper. Combine and cook gently on medium-low heat.
- About 1-2 minutes before the pasta is done cooking (the garlic should not be brown), use tongs to add the pasta directly to the pan and toss vigorously to combine and emulsify the sauce.
- Keeping the pan on medium-low heat, add the juice of 1 lemon, a small pour of olive oil, and (optionally) chopped parsley. Combine and add 1/4 cup very hot pasta water to the pan and toss to combine.
- In a separate bowl, combine 2oz shredded parmesan, 1 egg and 1 egg yolk, and 1 Tbsp heavy cream. Stir to combine.
- Remove the pan from the heat and slowly add the egg slurry, stirring it in to combine. Add pasta water to loosen the sauce as necessary. Add salt and pepper to taste.
