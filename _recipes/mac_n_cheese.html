ingredients:
- 0.5 lb macaroni or cavatappi
- 6 oz evaporated milk
- 6oz cheddar or jack cheese
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Paprika
- Garlic powder
- Red pepper flakes
- Cayenne powder
- Ground mustard

directions:
- Add pasta to a pot and add enough water to just cover the pasta. Lightly salt the water and cook over high heat until the pasta is done.
- Turn off the heat but keep the pot on the burner. Add the evaporated milk.
- Grate in cheese and mix until the milk is absorbed and the mixture starts to tighten. Mix in just enough evaporated milk to loosen the mixture. Repeat until the desired amount of cheese is added.
- Add spices as desired.
- When reheating, microwave the pasta then mix in a splash of evaporated milk to restore the creamy texture.
