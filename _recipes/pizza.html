recipe_yield: 2 pies

ingredients:
- 470g bread flour
- 25g sugar
- 1.5g instant yeast
- 285g ice water
- 9g kosher salt
- 13.5g olive oil
- 4 cloves garlic, roughly chopped
- Red pepper flakes
- 28oz can San Marzano tomatoes
- Onion powder
- Dried oregano
- Corn meal
- 12-16oz Low-moisture mozzerella cheese, grated

directions:
- The night before, prepare the dough. In a food processor, mix together bread flour, sugar, and yeast. Slowly stream in ice water until it forms a rough ball of dough. Let rest for 15 minutes.
- Add 9g kosher salt and 13.5g olive oil. Process for 90 seconds or until a soft and smooth dough forms.
- Knead on a lightly oiled surface until it cohesively comes together. Proof in a greased, covered container in the fridge overnight.
- Divide dough in half and form into balls. Let rest covered on a floured baking sheets for 2 hours.
- About halfway through the resting time, preheat the oven to the maximum temperature with a pizza stone in the top third rack. Allow the stone to heat up for at least 1 hour.
- Heat olive oil to a medium saucepan over medium heat. Sauté garlic for 1-2 minutes. Add red pepper and sauté another 15-20 seconds.
- Add the whole can of tomatoes. Stir and lightly break up the tomatoes. Add onion powder, dried oregano, and kosher salt. Simmer for 30-45 minutes.
- Purée the sauce in a blender until smooth.
- Prepare the toppings. For eggplant/mushroom, Slice the vegatables about 1/4" thick. Heat olive oil in a pan over medium. Add eggplant and salt to taste. Sauté on both sides and remove to cool. Then, add mushrooms and salt. Sauté until most of the moisture is removed.
- Carefully shape one ball of dough into a 12"-14" pie with a thin crust.
- Generously dust a pizza peel with cornmeal. Carefully move the dough onto the peel. Working quickly to prevent sticking, ladel on about half the sauce and spread to about 1/2" from the edge. Cover with half the cheese, 6-8oz. Add toppings.
- Lightly shake the peel to check for sticking. Lift the pizza and add cornmeal if it sticks anywhere. Slide the pizza onto the peel and bake 7-9 minutes and cool on a wire rack.
