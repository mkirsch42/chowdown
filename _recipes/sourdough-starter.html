Recommended flour type is a 50/50 mix of bread flour and whole wheat. Any flour will work except bleached all-purpose. 
Ideally feed the starter every day, although the starter can last a few days unfed in the fridge.

The total yield is 120 grams and the next starter needs 20 grams of the mature starter, so there is 100 grams of sourdough discard each feeding.
This can be stored in a fridge to accumulate for [Sourdough Discard Recipes](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/collections/sourdough-discard-recipes). When a layer of liquid forms on top of the discard, it has gone bad and must be thrown out.
