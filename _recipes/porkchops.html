recipe_yield: 2 Chops

ingredients:
- 2 Pork chops, bone-in
- Olive Oil
- Kosher Salt
- Black Pepper
- Garlic Powder
- 1 tsp Liquid Smoke
- 4 Tbsp Butter
- 1 oz. Bourbon
- 1/4 cup Brown Sugar
- 1 Tbsp Dijon Mustard
- 1/2 Tbsp Worcestershire Sauce
- Lemon (optional)

directions:
- Preheat oven to 375&deg; F.
- Fill a bowl with 1 quart of warm water and 1/4 cup kosher salt. Mix to mostly combine, add pork chops, and brine for at least 15 minutes, flipping halfway through.
- Rinse the chops with cold water and pat dry with paper towels.
- Rub the chops on both sides with olive oil to lightly coat. Season with salt, coarsely ground black pepper, garlic powder, and liquid smoke on both sides, pressing the seasonings into the meat.
- Heat a cast-iron or stainless steel skillet over high heat with olive oil until barely smoking, about 5 minutes.
- Carefully place the chops into the skillet and sear for 2-3 minutes or until golden.
- Flip the chops with tongs and quickly put the skillet into the oven.
- Bake for about 2 minutes, flip, then bake another 2-4 minutes until the pork reaches an internal temperature of 145&deg; F.
- Remove the pork chops onto a plate to cool. Spoon some of the juices onto the chops, reserving some in the pan.
- Deglaze the pan with the butter and bourbon. Add the brown sugar, dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, a pinch of salt, and optionally a squeeze of lemon juice. Mix to combine, and heat until the sauce thickens and starts to bubble.
- Pour the sauce into a container or on top of the pork chops.

The exact measurements need some adjusting, especially for the sauce.
