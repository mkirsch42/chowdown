recipe_yield: 2 boules

ingredients:
- 200g Flour
- 200g Water, 80° F
- 1 Tbsp [Sourdough starter](!!!/recipes/banana-bread), mature
- 900g Bread flour (90%)
- 100g Whole wheat flour (10%)
- 750g Water, 80° F (75%)
- 20g Salt (2%)

directions:
- To make the leaven, feed the starter with 200g flour and 200g water. Cover with a kitchen towel and let rise covered overnight at cool room temperature (65° F). A tablespoon of properly risen leaven will float in a bowl of warm water.
- Add 700g water to the leaven and stir to disperse. Add all flour and mix until no dry flour remains. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and let rest covered for 25 to 45 minutes.
- Add 20g salt and 50g water. turn onto a lightly floured work surface and knead with lightly wetted hands for 10-15 minutes. Pull off a small amount of the dough with wetted hands; fully kneaded dough should be able to be gently stretched until light shines through without tearing.
- Let rest lightly for 30 minutes, then turn the dough by scooping and stretching the edge of the dough with a wetted hand, folding on top of the dough, turn the bowl 90 degrees, and repeating until the bowl has fully rotated (4 stretch & folds total).
- Do a set of stretch & folds every 30 minutes for 3 hours, covering the bowl with a damp kitchen towel while resting.
- Turn the dough onto an unfloured work surface. Lightly flour the top of the dough. Cut the dough into two even pieces and flip each piece so the floured side is on the bottom.
- Preshape the boules. Using your hand and a dough spatula, gently rotate one piece of the dough into a round shape, allowing it to lightly anchor to the work surface to build tension. Gently shift it between your hands in a circular motion to build more tension, keeping your hands on the work surface. 
- Repeat with the second piece. Let both boules rest covered with a kitchen towel for 30 minutes. The edge should appear fat and rounded after resting. If it looks flat and tapered, preshape the boules again to build more tension.
- Shape the dough. Lightly flour the top of each boule and pat lightly to spread throughout. Turn upside-down so the floured side is on the work surface. Stretch the third of the dough closest to you up and over the middle third. Repeat with the right, left, than farthest thirds. Lightly anchor the final fold then roll the dough away from you so the seam is on the bottom.
- Gently shift it between your hands in a circular motion to build more tension, keeping your hands on the work surface. The boule should have a thin, taut layer on top. Do not overwork the dough or the layer will break. Repeat the shaping with the other boule.
- Heavily flour two kitchen towels and press the flour in. Line two bowls with a towel, flour side up. The bowls should not be too wide, or the boules will flatten. Put each boule into a bowl, seam side up. Fold the towels over boules to lightly cover them. Let rest in the fridge overnight, 8 to 12 hours.
- Preheat to 500° F.
- 20 minutes before baking, remove a boule from the fridge and put an empty dutch oven and lid into the oven.
- Flip the boule from the bowl into the dutch oven so the seam side is down. Score the top of the dough with a razor blade or lame, cutting 0.5" - 1" deep with smooth, quick motions.
- Cover the dutch oven and put into the oven. Immediately lower the oven to 450° F. Bake for 20-25 minutes.
- Remove the dutch oven lid to remove the steam. Bake another 20-25 minutes or until deep golden brown with slightly black edges. The bottom should sound very hollow if tapped with the handle of a knife.
- Reheat the oven to 500° F and repeat for the second boule.
- Allow each boule to cool completely, 1 - 2 hours, before slicing.
