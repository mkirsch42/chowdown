recipe_yield: 9 brownies

ingredients:
- 1 stick butter
- 1/2 cup cocoa powder
- 14oz sweetened condensed milk
- 1 cup powdered sugar
- Kosher salt
- 2 teaspoons vanilla
- 2 teaspoons molasses (optional)
- 1 teaspoon instant espresso powder
- 1 egg yolk
- 90g all-purpose flour
- 2 oz baking chocolate, 60-75% cocoa

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 325&deg;F.
- Lightly brown the butter in a medium pot, stirring constantly to prevent the milk solids from sticking to the bottom.
- Add the cocoa powder to the butter and cook for about 1 minute.
- Remove from the heat and add the sweetened condensed milk and combine.
- Add the sugar and stir until no more clumps of sugar remain. Some milk solids will be in the batter; this is fine.
- Mix in a pinch of salt, the vanilla, molasses, espresso powder, and egg yolk. Mix in the flour with a wooden spoon.
- Chop the chocolate into small pieces and mix in after the batter cools off a bit.
- Spray a 8x8" or 9x9" baking pan with oil and line with parchment paper. Pour the batter into the pan; do not try to spread or level the batter.
- Bake for 30-40 minutes or until a skewer comes out mostly clean. Let cool at least 30 minutes before cutting.
