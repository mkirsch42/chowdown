- Baste one side of the ribs with the barbecue sauce. Place on the grill sauce-side down, then baste the other side.
- Cook the ribs until the sauce becomes sticky and grill marks have formed, then flip.
- Repeat basting and flipping up to a total of 4 times.
- Remove the ribs from the grill and allow to cool.
