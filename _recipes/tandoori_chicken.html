recipe_yield: 5 lbs chicken

ingredients:
- 5 lbs chicken drumsticks
- "2 Tbsp [Garam Masala](garam_masala)"
- 2 Tbsp Kashmiri chili powder (or 1.5 Tbsp cayenne + 0.5 Tbsp paprika)
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 1/2 cup full-fat greek yogurt
- 1.5 Tbsp grated ginger
- 1.5 Tbsp grated garlic
- Red food coloring
- Kosher salt

directions:
- Score the drumsticks on both sides and add to a glass or stainless-steel bowl.
- Sprinkle the chicken with kosher salt and mix in. Add garam masala until mostly coated. Add the ginger, garlic, lemon juice, yogurt, and food coloring then mix. Allow to marinate in the fridge for at least 2 hours, up to a day.
- Turn the broiler on high with a shelf on the upper-most rack. Assemble the chicken onto a wire rack on top of a rimmed baking sheet and carefully slide under the broiler.
- Broil until charred, about 10 minutes. Flip the chicken and broil for another 10 minutes.
- If the chicken is not yet 170&deg;F, bake in a 350&deg;F oven on the middle rack until done.
